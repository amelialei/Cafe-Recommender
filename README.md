# Cafe-Recommender

## Overview
This project builds a personalized cafe recommendation system using Yelp's academic dataset, which includes business and review data. The system applies collaborative filtering, sentiment analysis, and location-based filtering to provide cafe recommendations tailored to users' preferences. The system focuses on cafes and tea businesses, combining user similarity, sentiment analysis from reviews, cafe proximity, and business features like free WiFi.

## Features
**Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends cafes based on users with similar preferences.

**Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of user reviews.

**Location-Based Filtering:** Prioritizes cafes closer to the userâ€™s current location.
